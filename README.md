#### 🔬 KID-Whisper - Key Takeaways

**Model Family Studied:** OpenAI Whisper (Tiny to Large-v3)

**MyST Corpus Preprocessing & Filtering Steps Understood:**
- Raw MyST corpus: 499 hours total, 244,069 utterances, 1,372 students (Grades 3-5)
- Annotated subset: ~240 hours; usable after quality filtering: **133h train / 21h dev / 25h test**
- Filtering criteria: removal of utterances with transcription mismatches, very short segments, and high noise frames
- Spoken by children ages 8-10; conversational dialogue with a virtual science tutor

**Whisper Zero-shot WER% on MyST and OGI Test Sets:**
*Source: Fan et al. 2024 [2] - Table 2*

| Model | Params | MyST Test WER% | OGI Test WER% |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Whisper-tiny | 39M | 20.6 | 53.8 |
| Whisper-base | 74M | 16.8 | 38.0 |
| Whisper-small | 242M | 13.4 | 25.4 |
| Whisper-medium | 769M | 13.1 | 20.8 |
| Whisper-large | 1.55B | 12.5 | 22.9 |
| Whisper-large-v3 | 1.55B | 12.6 | 19.9 |

**After Fine-tuning on Children's Data (KID-Whisper paper, arXiv:2309.07927):**

| Model | Fine-tune Data | MyST Test WER% (zero-shot) | MyST Test WER% (fine-tuned) |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Whisper-small | MyST (KID-Whisper filtered) | 13.93% | **9.11%** |
| Whisper-medium | MyST (KID-Whisper filtered) | 13.23% | **8.61%** |

Note: KID-Whisper only fine-tuned and reported Small and Medium models. Large-v3 and Canary fine-tuning results are from Fan et al. 2024 (arXiv:2406.10507) which reports Whisper-largeV3 encoder fine-tuning at ~9.0-9.2% WER on MyST test. Canary 1B is reported zero-shot only (9.5%) in Fan et al. 2024 - no fine-tuned Canary result on MyST is publicly available.

**Key Observations:**
- Larger Whisper models do NOT always give best zero-shot children's WER (large vs large-v3 reversal on MyST)
- Fine-tuning on children's data gives ~30-50% relative WER reduction
- Domain gap between adult pre-training data and children's speech is the core challenge
- KID-Whisper specifically addresses bridging this gap with targeted fine-tuning strategies

#### 🔬 XLSR & XLS-R - Key Takeaways

**Base Architecture:** Both built on **wav2vec 2.0** (Baevski et al., NeurIPS 2020)
- CNN feature encoder (7 blocks, raw waveform to latent at 20ms stride)
- Shared product quantizer (cross-lingual discrete speech units)
- Transformer context network (24 layers, 1024 dims, 300M params)
- CTC head for ASR fine-tuning
- Pre-training: contrastive loss on masked latent representations

### ✅ Week 2 | Corpus Setup & Baseline Evaluation

#### 🗂️ MyST Corpus Filtering (KID-Whisper Methodology)

Applied KID-Whisper filtering pipeline on LDC2021S05 - test split results (cross-verified against raw data):

| Filter Step | Removed | Remaining | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw .flac files | - | 22,592 | ✅ |
| No transcription | -9,412 | 13,180 | ✅ |
| Flagged WER > 53% (FP16 adjusted) | -1,067 | 12,113 | ✅ |
| Non-speech tags (`<DISCARD>`, `<SILENCE>`, `<NO_SIGNAL>`) | -380 | 11,733 | ✅ |
| < 3 words (after tag stripping) | -1,318 | 10,415 | ✅ |
| **KEPT** | - | **10,415 utterances (26.1h)** | ✅ |

**Note on flagging threshold:** KID-Whisper paper uses 50% WER threshold with full-precision Whisper-Large. We run Whisper-Large in FP16 (8GB VRAM constraint), which produces slightly higher WER on borderline files. Threshold adjusted to 53% to match paper's reported 83-84 minutes of removed audio (our result: 83.4 minutes). Script: `scripts/clean_whisper_large_flags.py`

**Note on non-speech filtering:** Only files where the entire transcription is one of three exact tags (`<DISCARD>`, `<SILENCE>`, `<NO_SIGNAL>`) are removed. Files containing tags within speech (e.g. `<BREATH>`, `<LAUGH>`) have tags stripped but are kept. Word count filter runs on cleaned text after stripping.

- Filtered utterance counts (flac+trn pairs, verified):

| Split | Files | Duration | Filters Applied | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| train | 57,687 | 136.9h | all 4 filters + >30s removal | ✅ Final |
| development | 9,017 | 21.1h | all 4 filters + >30s removal | ✅ Final |
| test | 10,415 | 26.12h | all 4 filters + >30s removal (via chunking) | ✅ Final |

- WER flagging applied to all splits: train (2,823 flagged), dev (1,046 flagged), test (1,067 flagged) - scripts: `generate_flags_partition.py`, `clean_flags_partition.py`
- Filter 5 (>30s removal) added to match KID-Whisper methodology - utterances longer than 30s removed since Whisper is trained on 30s windows
- KID-Whisper reports train 132.5h / dev 21h - our results (136.9h / 21.1h) are close; remaining gap due to FP16 vs FP32 flagging difference
- Concatenated filtered test utterances into 30-second chunks for Whisper inference: 3,972 chunks
- `myst_train_text.txt` contains 59,842 lines - matches filtered train count exactly (cross-verified)

#### 🧪 Baseline Experiments - Whisper Large-v3 Zero-shot on Filtered MyST Test
*Our experiments - hardware: RTX 4060 8GB | normalizer: EnglishTextNormalizer (whisper_normalizer package) | evaluation script: calculate_wer.py*

| Decoding | Chunks | WER% | Inference Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Greedy | 3,972 | 15.31% | 33.5 min | No LM - our result |
| **Beam-5** | **3,972** | **14.46%** | **129.2 min** | **Official thesis baseline - our result** |
| Zero-shot ref (Fan et al. 2024) [2] | - | 12.60% | - | arXiv:2406.10507, Table 2 - Whisper Large-v3 zero-shot, no LM |

> **🎯 Official Thesis Baseline: WER = 14.46%**
> Model: Whisper Large-v3 | Decoding: Beam-5 | Corpus: MyST test (filtered) | Normalizer: EnglishTextNormalizer | Hardware: RTX 4060 8GB

#### 💡 Key Findings (Week 2)
- Beam-5 gives 0.85% absolute WER improvement over greedy on children's speech
- 1.86% gap between our result (14.46%) and published reference (12.60%, Fan et al. 2024) is due to different filtering methodology and test set construction - NOT LM rescoring. KID-Whisper (arXiv:2309.07927) only reports up to Whisper Large-v2 and uses no GPT-2 LM in main results
- Disfluency tokens (UH, UM) in MyST references inflate WER by ~4-5% if not normalized - EnglishTextNormalizer handles this correctly
- RTF: greedy = 0.031 (32x real-time), beam-5 = 0.125 (8x real-time) on RTX 4060 8GB

### ✅ Week 3 | Compression Experiments

#### 🔬 Part A - bitsandbytes Quantization (Black-box baseline)

All methods applied post-training to Whisper Large-v3. Beam-5 decoding, EnglishTextNormalizer, full test set (3,972 chunks).
*Source: Our experiments using bitsandbytes library (Dettmers et al. 2022 [13], 2023 [14])*

| Method | Scheme | WER% | Size | RTF | vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FP16 (reference) | Half-precision float | 14.46% | 2.87 GB | 0.125 | - |
| INT8 - LLM.int8() | Absmax + FP16 outlier cols | 14.60% | 1.51 GB | 0.145 | +0.14% |
| NF4 4-bit | Normal float quantile grid | 14.48% | 0.82 GB | 0.098 | +0.02% |
| FP4 4-bit | Float point 4-bit format | **14.05%** | 0.82 GB | 0.098 | -0.41% |

#### 🔬 Part B - Our PyTorch Absmax Per-Channel PTQ (Thesis Contribution)

Implemented from scratch in pure PyTorch. Same method across all bit widths - only the quantization range changes. 513 Linear layers quantized (99.5% of all parameters). Weights stored as int8 in all cases; theoretical sizes assume native N-bit packing.
*Source: Our implementation - scripts/10_ptq_int8_pytorch.py, scripts/11_ptq_unified.py*

| Bits | Levels | WER% | Actual Size | Theoretical Size | Reduction | Eval Set |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 (FP16) | 65,536 | 14.46% | 2.87 GB | 2.87 GB | - | Full (3,972) |
| 8 (INT8) | 255 | 14.48% | 1.57 GB | 1.57 GB | -45.3% | Full (3,972) |
| 4 (INT4) | 15 | 620.91% | 1.57 GB | 0.73 GB | -74.5% | Full (3,972) |
| 2 (INT2) | 3 | 100.00% | 1.57 GB | 0.38 GB | -86.9% | 200 samples |
| 1 (Binary)| 2 | 100.00% | 1.57 GB | 0.20 GB | -93.1% | 200 samples |

#### 🔬 Part C - Layer Pruning (no recovery)

Removed last N layers from Whisper Large-v3 encoder (32 layers total). Decoder untouched.
*Source: Our experiments - scripts/07_compress_pruning.py*

| Method | Encoder Layers | WER% | Size | RTF | vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FP16 (reference) | 32/32 | 14.46% | 2.87 GB | 0.125 | - |
| Pruning 2L | 30/32 | 623.19% | 2.80 GB | 0.575 | +608.73% |

#### 🔬 Part D - Calibrated Absmax PTQ (Our Extension - Thesis Contribution)

Extends Part B with two calibration strategies to fix INT4 collapse. Same absmax per-channel method but with improved scale estimation.
*Source: Our implementation - scripts/12_ptq_calibratedWithFP32.py*

**Strategy 1 - Percentile clipping (no calibration data):**
Replace `max(|W|)` with `percentile(|W|, 99.9)` per output channel. Prevents single outlier weights from pulling the scale so wide that 99%+ of near-zero weights collapse to 0.

**Strategy 2 - Activation-aware scaling (calibration data required):**
Combine weight percentile with actual MyST encoder activation statistics using smoothing factor alpha. Scale = `(weight_pct^(1-alpha) * act_pct^alpha) / max_val`. Inspired by SmoothQuant (Xiao et al. 2022 [15]). Tested with 128 filtered MyST train utterances (57,687 files / 136.9h after all 4 filters + >30s removal).

| Method | Calib Data | Alpha | WER% | Size | Eval Set | vs Naive INT4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Naive INT4 (reference) | None | - | 620.91% | 1.57 GB | Full (3,972) | - |
| Percentile INT4 (p=99.9) | None | - | **19.00%** | 1.57 GB | Full (3,972) | -601.91% |
| Act-aware INT4 (CA-2) | 128 MyST utterances | 0.5 | 100.00% | 1.57 GB | 200 samples | worse |
| Act-aware INT4 (CA-3) | 128 MyST utterances | 0.1 | 392.36% | 1.57 GB | 200 samples | worse |

#### 💡 Key Findings (Week 3)

- **8-bit is the minimum viable bit width for absmax linear quantization on Whisper** - below 8-bit the model fails completely. 4-bit hallucinates (WER 620%), 2-bit and 1-bit produce empty transcriptions (WER 100%, Matches 0/200)
- **Quantization scheme matters more than bit width** - bitsandbytes NF4 at 4-bit (WER 14.48%) outperforms our linear INT4 at 4-bit (WER 620.91%) by placing quantization levels at the quantiles of the normal weight distribution rather than equally spaced
- **Our INT8 (14.48%) outperforms bitsandbytes INT8 (14.60%)** - per-channel absmax scaling preserves more information than bitsandbytes vector-wise scaling for this task, and is 30% faster (RTF 0.101 vs 0.145) on consumer GPU
- **FP4 produces best overall result (14.05%)** - 0.41% better than FP16 baseline, suggesting quantization noise acts as mild regularization on this test set
- **Percentile clipping alone recovers 97% of INT4 collapse** - naive INT4 at 620.91% drops to 19.00% by simply replacing max(|W|) with 99.9th percentile - no calibration data required
- **Activation-aware scaling makes INT4 worse, not better** - children's speech produces large encoder activations (act_pct >> weight_pct). The geometric mean formula widens quantization scales rather than tightening them, pushing near-zero weights back to zero. Even alpha=0.1 gives 392.36% WER. The correct solution is NF4's quantile grid which places levels where weights actually exist, not relative to activation magnitude
- **Naive layer pruning is catastrophic** - removing just 2 of 32 encoder layers causes 623% WER, motivating LoRA recovery as the next phase
- **2-bit and 1-bit failure modes differ from 4-bit** - 4-bit hallucinates (decoder runs to token limit), 2-bit/1-bit collapse weights to zero (decoder produces empty outputs)
